write your observations:
I often log in and switch between multiple GitHub accounts using gh auth login and gh auth switch.
I regularly create new branches with git checkout -b to work on features separately.
I use git add and git commit repeatedly to save my changes locally.
I set up my Git identity using git config --global user.name and git config --global user.email to keep commits traceable.
I initialize new local repositories with git init whenever starting a project from scratch.
I clone existing GitHub repositories using gh repo clone to work on remote projects locally.
I link local repositories to remote ones with git remote add origin to push changes.
I regularly fetch updates from the main branch using git fetch and merge or rebase to stay up to date.
I frequently check my current Git status using gh auth status or git status to confirm my workflow.
